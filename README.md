# IVS project 1
Source files for first project in IVS course (it was about testing, obviously) which include black-box/white-box testing and test driven development.

Unfortunately, I don't exactly remember the final evaluation and can't find it anywhere (rip wis) but it was something around 14/18. 

## For FIT students that came for an inspiration
Feel free to get inspired as much as you like but remember, anything too much is bad.
